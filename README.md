# Airline-Crew-management

This project focuses on optimizing aircraft scheduling and crew allocation using Linear Programming (LP), Integer Programming (IP), and Markov Decision Processes (MDP). The goal was to minimize weather-related delays and reduce crew deployment inefficiencies, aligning closely with real-world airline operational challenges.

Key Highlights:
Reduced weather-related delays by 80% using LP models built with PuLP.

Cut crew usage by 40% by integrating IP and simulating crew availability with MDP.

Incorporated real-time operational constraints such as flight timings, crew rest requirements, and aircraft turnaround times.

Designed the solution to be scalable and adaptable for dynamic inputs, enabling real-time decision support.

Tools Used: Python, PuLP, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.

This project demonstrates the power of operations research techniques in improving airline efficiency, scheduling robustness, and resource utilization.
